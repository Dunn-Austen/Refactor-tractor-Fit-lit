*Compare our product with the original product outlined in the lower portion
of this ReadMe below*

## Setup

Clone the repo.
Run npm install to ensure all dependencies are running.

## Project details

We were given the FitLit App below to work through and build upon using some
additional, new technologies.

### Key focus areas and objectives were to:
- Get familiar with the existing code base
- Find and refactor any areas for more DRY/Dynamic code
- Resolve any accessibility and cross-browser compatibility issues
- Implement inheritance, Sass, fetch requests, spies, and enhanced Git workflow

### Pain Points and Wins
- There are open issues that we would have liked to resolve with more time
- We did not have a chance to begin implementing spies in our testing suite
- Our refactored project passes the chrome accessibility audit with a score of
  100 after beginning with a score of 61.
- Fetch requests for 'get' and 'post' were successfully implemented
- Classes were successfully refactored for use inheritance
- We each gain some exposure to various features of Sass
